# Omakub

Forked from [basecamp/omakub](https://github.com/basecamp/omakub/).

Turn a fresh Pop!_OS installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern web development and gaming system by running a single command. Customised for my personal apps and preferences. 

Watch the introduction video and read more at [omakub.org](https://omakub.org) for a general idea.
